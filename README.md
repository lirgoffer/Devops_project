This project sets up a server using Express, connects to a MongoDB database using Mongoose, and defines routes for handling requests related to grades. On the website it is possible to see the data. In addition, we added a user's grade average and the user with the lowest average and the user with the highest average.

The environment we used is Microsoft Azure is- a cloud computing platform that offers a wide range of services and features to support application development, deployment, and management in the cloud. It provides the infrastructure and tools necessary to host and scale applications, store data, and utilize various cloud services.
